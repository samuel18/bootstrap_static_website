                            our own kind of winter as the weather changes and becomes extremely cold. The 
                            moment you start seeing people with cracked lips and pale body parts (face, hands
                            and legs), then harmattan has hit them hard. During harmattan, people often 
                            complain about their skin losing its suppleness and colour; some people’s skin 
                            look so dry and pale you will be left wondering the kind of cream they use. 
                            The dustiness of the environment is another thing you need to worry about as this 
                            wind brings in dust. The haziness of the atmosphere also makes it difficult to 
                            drive around as you may not be able to see from afar because of the fogginess.
